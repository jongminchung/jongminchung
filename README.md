## Packages

This repository owns the shared `@jongminchung` packages used by downstream projects.

- `@jongminchung/tooling`: shared `oxfmt`, `oxlint`, and package-map configuration.
- `@jongminchung/remark-plantuml`: shared PlantUML rendering for Markdown and Astro docs.
- `@jongminchung/theme-contract`: private CSS-only adapter for the apps' shared semantic vocabulary.

Public packages are published to GitHub Packages. Consumers need the `@jongminchung` scope mapped
to `https://npm.pkg.github.com`.

The apps own their theme values and components. See [DESIGN_SYSTEM.md](./DESIGN_SYSTEM.md) for the
token contract, component ownership rules, and runtime exception policy.

## Workspace scripts

Repository-wide scripts are owned by the workspace root. Use `-w` so they resolve to the root even
when the current directory is inside an app or package:

```bash
pnpm -w run fmt
pnpm -w run check
pnpm -w run audit:prod
```

Always include `run` for package scripts. The shorter `pnpm fmt` form can fall through to an
unrelated system command when the current package does not define `fmt`.

`audit:prod` queries the registry advisory database and fails on high-severity production
dependency findings. It runs in the scheduled security workflow instead of the offline-reproducible
`check` chain.

Each workspace owns its build, typecheck, and test commands. Select one with a filter instead of
adding a package-specific wrapper to the root manifest:

```bash
pnpm --filter @jongminchung/engineering-docs run build
```

## Version Policy

Published package versions are immutable. Increment the stable SemVer version before publishing
changed contents: patch for compatible fixes, minor for compatible features, and major for breaking
contracts. Never delete and republish an existing version.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run check
pnpm run publish:dry-run
```
